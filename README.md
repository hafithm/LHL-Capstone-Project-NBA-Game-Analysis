# NBA-Game-Prediction-Model
Develop a predictive model to forecast NBA game outcomes, using historical game data. The model should help in calculating betting odds and assist team management in player development strategy.

## Project/Goals
For this project, we'll apply everything we've learned in the course by doing the following:

1. Use pgadmin to write SQL queries for data retrieval.
2. Clean the data using Python.
3. Develop an interactive dashboard using Tableau.

We'll bring together all our bootcamp skills in a comprehensive project. This includes:

- Getting data through SQL.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning with Python.
- (Optional) Building statistical models.
- Visualizing data with Tableau.

The key outputs will be:

- One or more Tableau dashboards.
- A presentation of our work.
- Jupyter notebooks, if we use them.
